1. Iris Flower Classification

Objective:
To classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

Steps Performed:
Loaded the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
Split into training and testing sets.
Trained a Random Forest classifier.
Predicted species on test data.
Evaluated model with accuracy score and classification report.

Tools Used:
Python
Scikit-learn (dataset, model, evaluation)

Outcome:
Achieved high classification accuracy (>95%) on the test set, showing the modelâ€™s effectiveness for flower species identification.
